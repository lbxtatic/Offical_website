# Xtatic Website Starter

A fast, modern static starter for Xtatic — after‑school programs + CRM platform.

## Files
- `index.html` — semantic markup with sections for Hero, Programs, Platform, Impact, About, Contact.
- `styles.css` — responsive, accessible design with CSS variables.
- `script.js` — mobile nav, smooth scroll, simple contact demo.
- `assets/logo.svg` & `assets/favicon.svg` — placeholders you can replace.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.
2. Edit copy to match your campus/region links.
3. Deploy on any static host:
   - **GitHub Pages**: push the folder; set the repo to Pages.
   - **Netlify**: drag‑and‑drop folder into the dashboard.
   - **Vercel**: `vercel` from the folder (or import via UI).

## Customize
- Replace `support@xtatic.online` with your preferred inbox.
- Add real links for sign‑up or CRM demo.
- Swap the colors in `:root` or tweak radius/shadows.

## Notes
- No build tooling required; plain HTML/CSS/JS.
- The contact form currently logs to console; wire it to your backend or a form service (e.g., Formspree) for production.
